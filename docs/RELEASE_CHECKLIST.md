## Important Warnings

### Never Commit EXEs to Git

- The `dist/` folder is gitignored for a reason
- EXE files are **release assets**, not source code
- Upload EXEs only to GitHub Releases as binary attachments
- Users should download from Releases, not clone the repo

### Version Sync

Before releasing, ensure version is consistent in:
- `src/folder_mover/__init__.py` → `PRODUCT_VERSION`
- `pyproject.toml` → `version`

## Release Asset Naming

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `FolderMoverPro.exe` | GitHub Release asset | User download |
| `Source code (zip)` | Auto-generated by GitHub | Developer use only |
| `Source code (tar.gz)` | Auto-generated by GitHub | Developer use only |

Tell users: **Download FolderMoverPro.exe, NOT the source code zip.**
